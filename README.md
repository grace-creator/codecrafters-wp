# codecrafters-wp
wordpress theme with JavaScript, HTML, php, CSS.

Welcome to the world of CodeCrafters, a new WordPress theme that brings together simplicity, flat design, and joyful colors to create a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate experience for users. 

CodeCrafters Theme Overview


CodeCrafters embraces the flat design concept, using symmetrical shapes such as circles, squares and rectangles. The theme features blocks of code that make it simple for the eye to navigate through information. I’m also designing custom icons and characters in a flat design style to create a visually appealing experience. CodeCrafters will offer both light and night mode options to cater to users’ preferences.
